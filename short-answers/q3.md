# Question

What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?

# Answer
Pros of recursion: 
- Easier to read and write 

Cons :
- Takes up more memory 
- Risk of stack overflow 

# Teacher Feedback
You’ve pointed out that recursive functions are generally easier to read and write. However, it would be helpful to add that this benefit is particularly noticeable in problems related to tree structures, hierarchical data, or where each sub-problem resembles the overall problem. Not every problem should be solved recursively, especially when the iterative approach is more optimal.

You correctly identified two major drawbacks of recursion: increased memory usage and the risk of stack overflow. It would be even more informative if you explained why these issues occur—specifically, how recursive calls consume stack memory with each function call until a base case is reached.

Lastly, your answer would be much stronger with specific examples illustrating both the pros and cons. For instance, showing a recursive function like calculating factorial or navigating a file directory can demonstrate the readability and elegance of recursion. On the other hand, trying to compute a very high Fibonacci number using recursion without optimizations could illustrate how quickly stack overflow and high memory usage can become problems.

# Question

What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?

# Answer
Pros of recursion: 
- Easier to read and write, it is best to use recursion with hierarchal data and tree structure type problems because it takes the whole data set and breaks it down into smaller sub-problems, which makes writing the code easier.

Cons :
- Takes up more memory, upon each time the function calls itself it consumes more memory because it has to perform the same action multiple times.
- Risk of stack overflow, if there are too many recursive calls before the base case is hit it can lead to stack overflow, which can lead to crashes and vulnerability.

Great answer n solid explanations for each! For future reference, code examples would've made this answer that much better, good job either way!

# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer
A recursive function is a function that calls itself within itself like a loop, Unlike loops, however, recursions processes a smaller version of the last processed data until it reaches a stopping point (the base case) . The cases are the base case, which is the condition that will cause the recursive function to stop. The recursion case is other case, which is the function calling itself, with added arguments causing the problem set being read to become less complex in order to complete the needed task .

# Teacher Feedback
Comparing recursion to a loop is a great analogy. However, it could be helpful to clarify that unlike loops, each recursive call processes a smaller version of the original problem until it reaches a stopping point, with the help of the 'call stack.' You can also mention the importance of the base and recursive cases.

# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer
A recursive function is a function that calls itself within itself like a loop. The cases are the base case, and the recursion case.

# Teacher Feedback
Comparing recursion to a loop is a great analogy. However, it could be helpful to clarify that unlike loops, each recursive call processes a smaller version of the original problem until it reaches a stopping point, with the help of the 'call stack.' You can also mention the importance of the base and recursive cases.

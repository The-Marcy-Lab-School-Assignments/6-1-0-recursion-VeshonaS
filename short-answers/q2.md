# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer
Recursion is all about breaking the big problem into smaller sub-problems. Fibonacci, or reversing a string are problems best used with recursion. With Fibonacci a large data structure is simplified into smaller pieces, with each element having a value of the previous two elements. REversing a string uses recursion by splitting the string into smaller parts and then reassembling them together.

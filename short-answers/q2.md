# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer
Fibonacci, or reversing a string.

# Teacher Feedback
You mentioned two specific examples where recursion can be useful: computing Fibonacci numbers and reversing a string. These examples are good because they demonstrate cases where recursion can be applied directly to break down the problem into smaller, similar problems. However, this response could be improved by explaining why recursion is suitable for these problems, emphasizing the idea of subproblems building on each other.

Your answer could be expanded to include a broader range of problems suited for recursion. Recursion is particularly effective for problems involving nested data structures or those that can be divided into similar sub-problems, like tree traversals, searching and sorting algorithms, or complex mathematical computations. Explaining this would provide a better understanding of when and why to use recursion.

Lastly, adding a bit more detail about how recursion simplifies complex problems would be very helpful. For example, in the case of Fibonacci numbers, you could explain how each number is the sum of the two preceding ones and how recursion naturally fits this structure by repeatedly breaking down the problem into smaller pieces. Similarly, for reversing a string, discussing how recursion can split the string into parts and then reassemble it in reverse order would illustrate the concept more clearly.
